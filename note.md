The conversation you provided references **three distinct medical devices**, all of which are used in **cardiac or surgical settings**. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

---

### ü´Ä **1. Heart‚ÄìLung Machine (Cardiopulmonary Bypass Machine)**

**Referenced explicitly multiple times.**

* **Function:** Temporarily takes over the work of the **heart and lungs** during surgeries such as **heart transplants or open-heart surgery**.
* **Purpose:** Maintains blood circulation and oxygenation while the heart is stopped.
* **Clinical importance:** Essential for major cardiac surgeries where the heart must be still for the procedure.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **2. Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) / Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)**

**Mentioned repeatedly.**

* **Function:** A mechanical pump that helps the heart‚Äôs ventricles pump blood to the rest of the body.
* **Use cases:**

  * **Temporary support** after heart surgery or while waiting for a heart transplant.
  * **Permanent therapy** for end-stage heart failure patients.
* **Specific mention:** The **Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD)** ‚Äî the most common type, attached to the left ventricle.

---

### ü©∏ **3. Cell Saver (Autotransfusion Device)**

**Described in detail later in the text.**

* **Function:** Collects, cleans, and returns a patient‚Äôs own blood lost during surgery.
* **Purpose:** Reduces or eliminates the need for donor (banked) blood transfusions.
* **Use:** Commonly used in cardiac, orthopedic, and vascular surgeries.
